1. Notion of function invocation. How the control flows. Concept of variables
   (including parameters being local to a function). We took a swap example.


2. Notion of "Everything is a (binary) number"
  - Base-2 notion. Byte. 2's complement concept.
  - Character as integer
  - ASCII

3. Operators in C 
  Arithmetic:
      numbers -> numbers
      + - / *     (dependnce on types)
  Conditional:
      numbers -> True/False
      == >= <=
  Logical:
      True/False -> True/False
      && || !

4. *TBD* Formally define the types and variable definitions in C
5. Simple if  and  while  using the conditionals above
   - notion of codes block in { }
6. Binary representation
       Simple notions of binary arithmetic
       * TBD * Bitwise operations and or and not
       * TBD * Other interesting operations: shift
