Planned:
1. Look at main.c, stats.c hello_world.[ch] 
2. Notion of "Everything is a (binary) number"
  * Character as integer
3. fillin_simple.c print_next_char.c
4. Formally define the types and declarations in C
5. Binary representation
       Simple notions of binary arithmetic
       Bitwise operations and or and not
       Other interesting operations: shift
5. Operators in C 
      numbers -> numbers
      + - / *     (dependnce on types)
      
      numbers -> True/False
      == >= <=

      True/False -> True/False
      && || !
