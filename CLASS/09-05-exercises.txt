Write programs in C for each of the following.
Make sure you put comments that explain your algorithm.

Every program consists of reading some input and printing some output.

In each case please test your program with several inputs 
covering multiple cases and seeing what the output is:

1. Read four integers, and print their mean, 
   median and the standard deviation.

2. Read two characters. Check first that they are both lower case alphabets.
   If the distance between the two is odd, then the middle character is unique. 
   Find and print it. 
   If the distance between them is even, then print the middle two characters.

3. Read three points each point represented by its x and y coordinates 
   which are floating point numbers  and 
   check if they are colinear and print the appropriate message.

4. Read a positive integer and compute the factorial of that number 
   by repeated multiplication - i.e.,  5! is 1*2*3*4*5  
   (You'll need a loop like whileto do this)

5. Write a program to read a character and test if it is an 
   upper case letter or a lower case letter and print the message

6. Read a fraction(ie, a float type), call it r (eg 0.3), 
   and a positive integer call it n (eg 10)
   Print the sum to n terms of the corresponding 
   geometric series starting at 1 and with r as the common ratio.

7. Read a positive integer n and test if it is prime by dividing it by 
   each integer from 2 to n-1. Print the conclusion.

8. Read a positive integer and determine if it is a power of two.
   Print your conclusion.

9. Look at the program 3np1.c on github. Modify it so that it counts how many
   intermediate numbers before it hit 1. Print that count.

10. Read a positive integer n. Then read n integers one by one. 
   After the n integers are read, print out their sum.
