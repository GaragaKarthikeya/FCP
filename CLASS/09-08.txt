Plan:
1. Repeat the main concepts in programming:
    Notion of stored variables
    Notion of algorithm with instructions
    C Programs comprise functions for instructions, variables as storage
    Define (declare) before use
    Notion of expression, assignment, statement and block;
	In particular assignment
        Recall the interesting m = n = 5 ;
    In C function calls only values are passed, not variables!
    Everything is binary
    Operators: Arithmetic, comparision and logical (we didnt do examples of logical)
    Arithmetic operation and (automatic) type conversions
        Recalle 13/2  is different from 13/2.0
    printf(), scanf() and elementery notion of the format string
    if (conditions) { } else { }
    while { }
    Always remember the (edit, compile, execute) loop
2. Towards end of class some unanswered questions include what is the & in scanf
3. 10 Exercises in 09-05-exercises.txt
   The aim today is to simply do all those exercises.
   Along the way we re-emphasises the notions studied so far. 
4. Homework:
   (1) Read for the quiz on 12-09 (Monday)
   (2) Read up about operator precedence (only for those operators taught in class). You can read from the Kernighan and Ritchie book (2nd Ed. pp 52-53) or from online sites, like: https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/operator_precedence
