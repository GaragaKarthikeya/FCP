DONE:

   Prototypes and declarations
   The notion of addresses as values
   The notion of pointer variable types to hold address values
   Examples of using pointers swap two variables.
        swapping pointers; we also saw pointers to pointers just for fun.
   We know why things go wrong if in scanf we do not give address of a variable

NOT CONVERED, at least some stuff pending. Moved to next class.
1. Constants and Operators
   Recall constants: integers  -32  76 (decial), 073(octal) 0xFF (hexadecimal) 
                    9.81 (float or double) 6.023E23 (exponential representation)
		    'h'  (characer)
 		    "hello" string
   BITWIZE operators   & | ^ (and or xor)  ~ (not)   << >> (shift operators)
   Arithmetic operators with effects:
       ++ -- += -= *= /=
   Precedence and Associativity
   Comparision operators (the compressed if-then-else) ?:  (a ternary operator!)
   There are no operators to compare strings
