DONE:
1. 
   Comparision/Relational operators
   BITWIZE operators & | (and or )  ~ (not)   << >> (shift operators)
   LOGICAL && || !
   Arithmetic/Bitwise operators with effects:
       ++ -- += -= *= /=
       similarly <<= >>= &= |= ^0 
   Precedence and Associativity
   Comparision operators (the compressed if-then-else) ?:  (a ternary operator!)
   Comma as an (unusual) operator

2. return statement in C, how functions return values;

3. SCOPE and LIFETIME of variables
   Static vs auomatic lifetime storage class
   local vs global visibioity scope
   We did many examples to illustrate these
