DONE:
1. Some common errors from in-class Exercise 1 and Exercise 2 on arrays
2. Revisit strings
3. We mentioned that there are a bunch of string library funcitons.
   We looked at 'man string' on Linux 
       (can also look for this on an internet search)
   We saw that it would take some effort if we wanted to implement those 
   functions themselves.
   Useful functions:  strcpy, strcat, strchr, strcmp, strlen 
   Student is urged to explore how these can be used.

4. FILE IO: We saw that scanf and printf were just simplified ways of using
   fscanf with 'stdin' or 'stdout' as a first argument.
   'stdin' and 'stdout' are pre-defined "FILE *" (FILE pointers).
   We can create our own file pointers that refer to a file on the disk using
   the fopen() function. We call this opening a file. 
   Refer 'man fopen'. 
	See fileio.c on our course github.
        We used the EOF as well.

5. Class assignment 2
