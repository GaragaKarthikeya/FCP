Write a function for the following:
Consider the string :

   "This is the  \n  house  \t\t that Jack  \n   	built"
char s[100] = " kkkkk " ;

It has newlines and tabs in it.

Initialize an array to this string.

From the array now just find individual words and write them out to the screen 
one line each.
 ------------------------------------------------------
As a second step now, only print those that are alpha-numeric.
So for example " Hello Mr 123, how;are you" will simple treat 
comma and semicolon as if they were blanks.
