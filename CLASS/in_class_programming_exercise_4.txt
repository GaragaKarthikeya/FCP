Define a structure with the following fields to hold information about
a student:
  - name (use an array of 20 characters)
  - scholarship : is an integer indicating one of two values
		0 - not a scholarship holder
		1 - is an active scholarship holder
  - amount : if the student holds a scholarship, then the amount.
		if the student does not hold a scholarship, it is neglected 
  - score  : an integer indicating total marks


Functions on the student:
  - read_student(struct student * s)
		will read student info for a student form the user
  - print_student(struct student s)
		will print student info for a student
  - print_scholarhsip_holders(struct student s[], int n)
		will look at s[0]..s[n-1] and print only
		those student's names who are scholarship holders
  - compute_total_amount(struct student s[], int n)
		will print the total scholarship amount spent on
		students who are receiving scholarship
  - set_scholarship(struct student s[], int i, int amount)
		sets s[i] to be an active scholaship holder
		and sets that person's scholarship amount to the given value
  - find_best_non_scholarship(struct student s[], int n)
		Of all the non-scholarship holders, find the one
		with maximum score.


Now write a main() function to read student info into an array
of structures, then print a menu for the operations above. 
Ask user for input and perform the operation.
