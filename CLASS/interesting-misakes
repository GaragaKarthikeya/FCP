I try to list a few interesting mistakes I see students make

1. Copying arrays: Student wants to copy tha string in the array s[] to
   the newly allocated array in t;
   char s[10] = "hello"
   chat *t = (char *) malloc(10);
   ...
   t = s;	// This does not copy strings. You may use strcpy instead

2. Comparing three numbers: students wants to check if a,b, and c are in
	increasing order:
   if (a < b < c) 	// will evaluate to true even if a=3, b=2, c=1
	printf("yes");

   instead use
   if (a < b && b < c)
	printf("yes");

3. Pointer to a variable:
   int *p;
   *p=5;
   Here the student assumed that since p was a pointer to an integer it must
   already be pointing to an integer. 
   But that is not true. We must assign p the address of an integer before
   we can use the expression "*p".

4. Returning a pointer to a local variables inside a function
   sometimes students return a pointer to a variable which is locally
   defined (automatic storage class). 
   Remember this variable itself does not exist beyond the function. So
   it will not work as intended.

5. Using variables without initializing them:
   Students occasionally assume that dynamic or local variables 
   must be zero by default.  Not true in C.
