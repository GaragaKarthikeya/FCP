Purpose:
  The idea is to list some good stuff to know about using Linux
  
  Each items has either a concept, command or utilities
  Where there is a command, common use case(s) is given with a "$" as prompt

1. file  commands 
  1.1 cat
    $ cat <filename>		       to see the text in a file
  1.2  more
    $ more <filename>		       to see the text in a file, but pagewise
  1.3 ls 
    $ ls    to see the files in the directory
    $ ls  <filename>
    $ ls  <dirname>
  1.4 cp 
    $ cp  <existing-file> <new-file>   to create another file with same content
  1.5 mv
    $ mv  <existing-name> <new-name>   to rename a file
  1.6 rm
    $ rm  <filename>  		       to remove(delete) a file
2. concept -   about tree structure directory hiarchy
3. direcory commands
  3.1 pwd
    $ pwd    				to see which directory we are at
  3.2 cd
    $ cd <dirname>			to change the current directory
  3.3 mkdir
    $ mkdir <new-dirname>		to create a new directory with the name
  3.4 rmdir
    $ rmdire <dirname>			to delete(remove) the named directory

4. *Editing* utilities vim (preferred), gedit
  remember vi has an insert mode Enter the mode with "i" and exit with ESC key
  See https://devhints.io/vim    
  $  vim <filename>

5. *utilities* grep, shuf, sort, date, wc, man

6. concept -  shell :  
	bash as an example
	varaibles: $PWD, $PATH, $HOME, $USERNAME, ...
	builtin commands: history, alias, exit, ...
	shortcuts on the command-line: !! and !$ and the <tab> key ...
	redirecting and piping input and output >, < and | ...
