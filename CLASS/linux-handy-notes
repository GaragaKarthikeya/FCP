1. file  commands  : How to view, copy, list, rename and remove files
-----------------
  1. cat
    $ cat <filename>	       to see the text in a file
  2. more
    $ more <filename>	       to see the text in a file, but pagewise
  3. ls 
    $ ls    		       to see the list of files in the current directory
    $ ls  <dirname>		to see all files in a directory <dirname>
    $ ls  <filename>		to list the file <filename>
  4. cp 
    $ cp  <existing-file> <new-file>   to create another file with same content
  5. mv
    $ mv  <existing-name> <new-name>   to rename a file
  6. rm
    $ rm  <filename>  		       to remove(delete) a file

2. concept - directory structure
--------------------------------
   1. Note that in linux (and most operating systems) files are thought of 
   as existing in a tree structure.
   2. A directory is a place to hold any number of files or other directories
   3. Example 
       / is the top level directory - also called the root
       /home is the directory "home" under "/"
       /home/lab is the directrory "lab" under "home" which is under "/"
       /home/lab/file1.c is the file "file1.c" sitting inside the "lab" directory
   4. Often we need to use the commands in "files" above so as to 
     copy them and move them from one directory to another. 
   5. 'current directory' :
     At any time at the command prompt we have a directory that we call
     the current directory of that terminal which is used in many commands. 
     The concept of current directory is important to know 
     to understand how many commands work:

3. directory commands - how to know create, remove and change to directories
------------------------------
  3.1 pwd
    $ pwd    			show the current directory
  3.2 cd
    $ cd <dirname>		change the current directory to <dirname>
  3.3 mkdir
    $ mkdir <new-dirname>	create a new directory <new-dirname>
  3.4 rmdir
    $ rmdir  <dirname>		delete(remove) the directory <dirname>

4. A note about file and directory names 
----------------------------------------
   <filename> in the above can be one of:
   can be of three types:
        1. <simple-filename>             Eg. cat file1.c
        2. /<dirpath>/<simple-filename>  Eg. cat /home/lab/newdir/file1.c
        3. <dirpath>/<simple-filename>   Eg. cat newdir/file1.c

        Type-1 assumes file1.c is in the current directory
        Type-2 assumes file1.c is in the directory /home/lab/newdir
	Type-3 assumes file1.c is in the directory newdir which is inside the current directory
    Similarly <dirname> can be one of:
	1. <simple-dirname>		Eg. mkdir newdir
	2. /<dirpath>/<simple-dirname>	Eg. mkdir /home/lab/newdir
	3. <dirpath>/<simple-dirname>	Eg. mkdir newdir/newsubdir
    Special directory names
	1. "/"  is the root(opmost) direcory       
		Eg. the command:    ls /        lists the root directory
	2. "."  is the current direcory
		Eg. the command:    ./a.out     executes the file a.out in the current directory
	3. ".." is the parent to the current directory
		Eg. the command:    cp ../main.c  .    copues the file called main.c from the parent directory to the current directory
   

5. *Editing* with vim 
---------------------
   $ vim <filename>
   ABOUT VIM
   *concept* - vim operates in two important modes:
	1. insert mode  - In this mode when you type it appears on the screen
			  so this is the mode to write code.
	2. editing mode - In this mode you can give commands (So also called "command" mode)
     In both these modes the arrow keys and pgup/pgdown  work as expected.
     when one opens a file vim starts in editing mode.

    **Commands in insert mode:**
     * There are no interesting commands just type and navigate using the arrow
        or page up/down keys
     * <ESC-key> pressing this key takes you to editing mode. 
        so press ESC key before trying out the following editing mode commands
     
    **Commands in editing mode:** There are a large number, we list a few:
     ** Moving around, in addition to arrow keys:
       * "G"      moves to the end of the file
       * ":25"    moves to the line number 25
       * ":se nu" shows line numbers
       * "w"	moves to the end of the current/next word
       * "b"	moves to the beginning of the current/next word
       * "^"	moves to the first character in the current line
       * "$"	moves to the last  character in the current line
       * "h","j","k","l"  work as if they were the arrow keys
                     (<Backspace-key> also moves left)
       * "Ctrl-u", "Ctrl-d" work as if they were page up and down keys

     ** Different ways to enter insert mode:
       * "cw"   deletes the word starting with the cursor position
                                       and puts it in insert mode
       * "i"    puts it in insert mode
       * "I"    puts it in insert mode at the beginning of the current line
       * "a"    puts it in insert mode after the current character
       * "A"    puts it in insert mode after the end of the current line
       * "o"    creates a new line below and puts it in insert mode there
       * "O"    creates a new line above and puts it in insert mode there

     ** Saving and Exiting:
       * ":w"	saves the current file
       * ":wq"     saves the current file and exits
       * ":x"      same as "wq"
       * ":q!"     exit without saving

     ** Deleting stuff:
       * "dd"   deletes the line with the cursor
       * "5dd"  deletes 5 lines starting with the cursor line
       * "x"    deletes the character under the cursor position (Same as <Delete-Key>)
       * "5x"   deletes 5 characters starting with the current position
       * "dw"   deletes the word starting with the cursor position

     ** Undo:
       * "u"    undo the edits 

     ** Searching
       * "/" followed by a string searches for a string in the file
		forward from the position where the cursor was
		Eg. "/main" goes to the place containing the word "main"
		    If you hit the <Enter-key> it will go back to edit mode
       * "?" is line "/" except it searches in the backward direction
       * "n" Once done a search with "/" or "?" this will repeat the search.
     
  
     vim has many more interesting commands, see https://devhints.io/vim
     for more information. Also just type vimtutor command to get a 
     guided tour.

6. *utilities* 
--------------
	* Linux has many utilities that are very useful. They are 
	  commands you can run at the prompt.
	* Useful utilities are : -  grep, shuf, sort, date, wc, man
	* Learn to use the "man" utitlity to understand more about
		each of these. eg try:  :~$  man wc

7. concept -  shell  
-------------------
        A shell is a program that runs to accept your commands. In fact,
	it is the shell which shows the prompt like ":~$"

	bash as an example of a shell and is the default shell on Ubuntu.

	*Shortcuts*
	bash is what lets you do a number of shortcuts. For example bash
	lets you use the arrow keys to go to previous commands and execute
	them. Other shortcuts include:
	!!  this reruns the last command
	the <tab> key is used for filename completion so "cat first_<tab>" will
	expand to "cat first_example.c", assuming that file is in the 
	current direcory.

	*Builtins*
	In addition to executing the Linux commands you give on the prompt,
	bash also has some builtin commands.
	Example useful builtin commands: history, alias, exit, ...

	bash also support some builtin variables:
	Examples useful varaibles: $PWD, $PATH, $HOME, $USERNAME, ...
	For example you can say the command : cd $HOME    to 
		change to the home directory

	*Redirection and piping*
	bash also lets you redirect input and output from a command. Eg:
	:~$ date > of   causes the output of "date" to be stored 
			in the file named "of" insted of on the terminal
	:~$ ./a.out < if causes the a.out to execute but read input from
			the file called "if" instead of the terminal
	:~$ cat first_example.c | sort      causes the output of the 
			first command, ie "cat first_example.c" to
			be the input of the second command ie "sort"
