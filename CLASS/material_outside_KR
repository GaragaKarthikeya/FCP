   Some material taught may not be available in the Kernighan and Ritchie
   text book on the C Programming language. So here are some references
   
   I believe all that material is available in :
   Robert Sedwick's algorithms book: A free downloadable version is available here:
https://theswissbay.ch/pdf/Gentoomen%20Library/Algorithms/Algorithms%20in%20C.pdf

NOTE: THE SAME BOOK is available as 4th edition which is perfectly good, except it uses C++. 

parts that are useful:
Ch 6 : Analaysis of algorithms
Ch 8 : Basic Sorting: insertion sort, selection sort and bubble sort - there are
	other sorts too, but you can neglect
Ch 12 : Mergesort: I would restrict to pages 163 - 166 which focusss on arrays
Ch 14 : page 198 has binary search. You may want to read the part before pp 198 it has
      some relevant stuff too.
