# Suggested texts to learn programming and the C language
This is a practical course. We learn only by doing!
However a good text is an asset especially when we 
wish to refer to how something works in C (syntax).

Use any textbook you wish. However as a very good
reference we can use the classic C book:  
_The C Programming Language_ by Kernighan and Ritchie, 2nd Edition.

**Remember you learn more by doing than by reading.**
