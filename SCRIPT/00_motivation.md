# Motivation
* OBJECTIVE:  This is motivation for students about why program. The idea is to say that we would like to codify an activity, an algorithm. To seed that idea we take simple mathematical examples.
  * Understand what an algorithm is
  * Write some common algorithms in as clear a way as possible
  * eg. GCD and LCM

* EXAMPLES: gcd.c and lcm.c
