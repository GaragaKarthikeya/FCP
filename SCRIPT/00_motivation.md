# Motivation
## Objective
  This is motivation for students about why program. 
## One way to look at Programming in general
  * The idea is that we would like to codify an activity, an algorithm. 
  To seed that idea we take simple mathematical examples.
  * Understand what an algorithm is
  * Write some common algorithms in as clear a way as possible
  * eg. GCD and LCM

## Examples
  * The algorithmic approach
    * Computers for Data Processing and Numerical Computation
    * Symbolic Computation
  * See how we go from algorithm to code in these two examples:
    * gcd.c 
    * lcm.c
