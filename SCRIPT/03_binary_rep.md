# BINARY REPRESENTATATION
* OBJECTIVE: Binary representations and arithmentic
* Important to know
* The notion of binary representations
  Why binary?
  examples of binary representations 0 1 2 4 8 3 5 7 16 15
  easier ways to talk binary - Octal and hexadecimal
  How to store a number in binary? examples
   (Just to understand you can see od -cx) and also refer ascii table
  One important concept is that a number like 108 needs only one bytes 
  However to store it as characters needs 3 bytes

  Lets spend some time here.
  Since all stuff is binary. So are non-numbers too.

* With some proactice can you refer ASCII table and say what is stored for 
  "good" in hexadecimal ? What about a word like "hello"?
  wha about doing a od -cx on a file containing exactly that.

* How does arithmetic work on binary numbers
  Addition

* The problem with representation and signs
  Subtraction is addition of 2's complement

* Bit operations (AND OR NOT)

* What is overflow ?
  Problems of integers and precision

* The more important thing is that everything is represented in binary 
	for example characters and even non integer floats

* QUESTIONS: can you use od -cx to see the contents of a file.
             In particular a character file?
	     Can you create a simple ASCII table (char vs hexadecimal)
	     convert these decimal numbers to binary and vice-versa
	     Why is hexadecimal so common ?
