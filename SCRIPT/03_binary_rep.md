# Binary Representatation
## Objective: Binary representations and arithmentic
## Binary Numbers in Computers
  * Important to know
  * The notion of binary representations
  * Why binary?
  * A game of coding Lets say A : "00" ; B : "01" ; C : "10" ; D : "11"
    * Can you decode **100001**
    * Can you encode **ABBA**
  * examples of binary representations 0 1 2 4 8 3 5 7 16 15
  * easier ways to talk binary - Octal and hexadecimal
  * How to store a number in binary? examples
   (Just to understand you can see od -cx) and also refer ascii table
  * One important concept is that a number like 108 needs only one bytes .
  However to store it as characters needs 3 bytes

  * Remember **all** stuff is in binary inside the computer. 
    So are non-numbers too.

  * With some proactice can you refer ASCII table and say what is stored for 
  "good" in hexadecimal ? What about a word like "hello"?
  wha about doing a od -cx on a file containing exactly that.

## Binary Operations
  * How does arithmetic work on binary numbers
  *Addition*

  * The problem with representation and signs
  *Subtraction* is addition of 2's complement

  * More operations in Binary world - Bit operations (AND OR NOT)

  * What is overflow ?
    Problems of integers and precision

  * The more important thing is that everything is represented in binary 
	for example characters and even non integer floats

## Exercise: can you use od -cx to see the contents of a file.
             In particular a character file?
	     Can you create a simple ASCII table (char vs hexadecimal)
	     convert these decimal numbers to binary and vice-versa
	     Why is hexadecimal so common ?
