# CONFIDENCE BUILDING EXERCISES AND A LITTLE MORE I/O
* OBJECTIVE: 
    * Student is more confident with number representations
    * Student can understand ASCII order
    * Student understands address vs value
    * Student udnerstands logical and other operators too
    * Operator precedence
    * Student understands the notion of a file and file-IO
    * Understand that a function is simply another control flow change
## EXPRESSIONS
* Simple expressions and simple programs
  * Write a simple program with input and outputs
  * Revisit the notion of expressions and values
  * Can you check print\_next\_char.c

* More on Expressions, lvalue and rvalue
  * Recall the notion of expression values
  * an interesting expression value is address
  * the notion of left and right side of assignment operator
  * lvalue and rvalue
  * the notion of address and a pointer variable type to hold address
  the way to print address and to print what is in an address

## IO
  * learn more about printf and scanf .... in particular scanf
  * reading a writing from files - fprintf, fscanf
  * fopen, fscanf
  * See fileio.c and io.c

## General suff
* remember to check the return value for error
* EXERCISE fillin\_file.c
* EXERCISE fillin\_simple.c
* EXERCISE The notion of function calls as simply changing flow of control: funcs.c 
     

## More on IO
* write more interesting programs using scanf and printf
* revisit the guessing problem.
* other problems like check if one number is a factor of another.

## More about operators
* ARITHMETIC OPERATORS in C
  * \+ - * / %
* LOGICAL OPERATORS in C
  * && || !
* BITWISE OPERATORS in C
  * & | ^

### Notion of operator precedence.

## END OF CLASS CHECK:
    * Student should be able to write a program corresponding to a simple word 
      problem. Eg. Find the number that is 1/5th of 17 more than twice the number.
    * .. how does one write the output of the hellow world program to a file?
    * Can you read an integer from a file and print twice its value to another file?
    * what does bitwise left shift to a number do?
    * Can you check if  a&b is giving you the right value through some examples?
