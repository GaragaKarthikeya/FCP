# Conditional Statements
## Objective
  * Why do we need conditionals
  * if and switch

## Attempt to write more useful programs:
  * The one that requires checking a condition
  * The one that requires repeatedly doing something
  * The one that requires us to store a large number of values of the same kind

##  Examples - go through by hand
  * read 2 numbers and print the maximum and the minumum
  * read a number and find its smallest factor > 1 
  * read a sequence of numbers and find the maximum
  * read a sequence of numbers and find the average
  * read a sequence of numbers and find the standard deviation
  * read a sequence of numbers and print them in reverse order
  * Find the mental constructs needed for each of these.
  * Note the need for comparision of some kind in each of these

##  IF () expression
  * Which problems can you solve
  * what about quadratic solving
  * Can you find max of  2 items
  *    what about 3 items ?
  *    what about 4 items ?
  *	Does the program grow really big?
  * EXERCISE fillin\_if.c  // answer is in find\_max.c ; 
   what if you wanted to do different things on different values of a variable.

## SWITCH() statement
  * read two integers x and y
  * read a third character
  * do the correspinding operation, see do\_op.c

* Why we should write well indented code. See examples.

* End of class check:
    * Student should be able to write a program to  swap two variables.
    * Student should be able to write a program to check that numbers are
      give in order, increasing or decreasing and make a statement.
