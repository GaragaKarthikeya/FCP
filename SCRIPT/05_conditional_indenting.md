CLASS 5:
* OBJECTIVE
    * Why do we need conditionals
    * if and switch

* Attempt to write more useful programs:
  * The one that requires checking a condition
  * The one that requires repeatedly doing something
  * The one that requires us to store a large number of values of the same kind
  EXAMPLES
	* read 2 numbers and print the maximum and the minumum
	* read a number and find its smallest factor > 1 
        * read a sequence of numbers and find the maximum
	* read a sequence of numbers and find the average
	* read a sequence of numbers and find the standard deviation
	* read a sequence of numbers and print them in reverse order
* Find the mental constructs needed for each of these.
* CONDITION checking
  IF () expression
	* Which problems can you solve
	* what about quadratic solving
	* Can you find max of  2 items
	*    what about 3 items ?
	*    what about 4 items ?
	*	Does the program grow really big?
   EXERCISE fillin_if.c  // answer is in find_max.c
   what if you wanted to do different things on different values of a variable.
   SWITCH() statements
	* read two integers x and y
	* read a third character
	* do the correspinding operation, see do_op.c

* Why we should write well indented code. See examples.

* END OF CLASS CHECK:
    * Student should be able to write a program to  swap two variables.
    * Student should be able to write a program to check that numbers are
      give in order, increasing or decreasing and make a statement.
