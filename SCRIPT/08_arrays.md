# ARRAYS
* OBJECTIVE :
    * Arrays definition
    * Arrays usage via  indexing
    * Arrays end
    * Array usage without loops
    * Array usage with loops
    * Student should be able to write a small program to
         read and and write into an array
         find an element in the array

## ARRAYS 
* arrays and for and while loops -  BE CAREFUL ABOUT THE END OF THE ARRAY
* arrays and reading from files
* writing arrays to files
* finding max in an array
* finding average of items in an array using for, while, do

## What problems can you solve
  * reverse a list of numbers and print in reversed order
  * compute the standard deviation of a given se of numbers
  * Using multiple arrays
	student_id[]
        marks_sub1[]
        marks_sub2[]
        marks_sub3[]
  * Find the student(s) with maximum marks in sub1.
    * Find the student(s) with maximum marks in all three subs taken together.
  * Using multiple arrays
    * list1[] has n integers
    * list2[] has m integers
    * make a new list list3[] with items from both list1[] and list2[]
    * what if you wanted to shuffle the elements of list1[] and list2 into list3
    * Assume list1 and list2 are sorted, can you merge them together into list3?
# END CLASS CHECK:
* Student should be able to write a small program to
    * read and and write into an array
    * find an element in the array
    * EXERCISE list\_avg\_array.c
