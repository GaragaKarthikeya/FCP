# STANDARD STRING LIBRARY FUNCTION in C
## OBJECTIVE:
  * String library usages
  * Notion of library

## WHY LIBRARY FUNCTIONS  
  *  The C library has many funcitons that make life easy
  *	Functions from string.h
  *	Functions from math.h
  *	Functions from ctype.h ... many others
  * Use the string.h functions to do some of the stuff we did earlier
  * Can you convert a string to an int and vice versa using functions
    in ctype.h
  * Use the math.h functions to do interesting stuff like powers and trignometry
  * Remember to always check return value for errors. Read the man page!

## END OF CLASS CHECK:
  * Student should be able to use string.h functions and strings in order 
    * to concatenate two strings.
    * to convert string to ascii and vice versa
    * to use the man page
