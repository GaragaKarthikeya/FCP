# Standard string library function in C
## Objective
  * String library usages
  * Notion of library

## Why library functions  
  *  The C library has many funcitons that make life easy
  * Functions from string.h
  * Functions from math.h
  * Functions from ctype.h ... many others
  * Use the string.h functions to do some of the stuff we did earlier
  * Can you convert a string to an int and vice versa using functions
    in ctype.h
  * Use the math.h functions to do interesting stuff like powers and trignometry
  * Remember to always check return value for errors. Read the man page!

## End of class check:
  * Student should be able to use string.h functions and strings in order 
    * to concatenate two strings.
    * to convert string to ascii and vice versa
    * to use the man page

## Exercises:
  * Check string\_library.c
  * try out fillin\_filio.c
