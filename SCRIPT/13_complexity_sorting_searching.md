# ALGORITHM COMPLEXITY NOTIONS
  * Complexity of matrix multiplication as an example
## SIMPLE SEARCH
  * Searching and complexity of searching
  * Simple linear search. try to create search.c
## BINARY SEARCH
  * Searching - can we do better than linear search
    * Searching in a sorted array binary-search.c
    * EXERCISE Look at search.c
## SORTING
  * rearranging elemtnts    - Sorting
  * Elementary sorting algos
	* insertion sort
	* selection sort
	* bubble sort
	* EXERCISE look at basic\_sorts.c
## COMPUTING THE COMPLEXITY
  * Computing their complexity
  * Big O notion - introductory level
