# ADVANCED SORTING - QUICKSORT
  * Algorithm - This is the more important part
    * Plan of the algorithm
    * How to get a good pivot (middle most?, worst ?)
    * How to partition around the pivot  (a) with extra space vs (b) in-place
    * EXERCISE start with fillin\_qsort.c (with extra space)  answer is in qsort\_extraspace.c
    * Hope and probability
    * The recursion - what is the base case (no further recursive calls needed)
    * Lets fill in the code
    * See qsort.c
