# Advanced Sorting - Quicksort

## The Algorithm 
  * Plan of the algorithm - This is the more important part
  * How to get a good pivot (middle most?, worst ?)
  * How to partition around the pivot  (a) with extra space vs (b) in-place

## Exercise
  * Start with fillin\_qsort.c (with extra space)  answer is in qsort\_extraspace.c

## Finishing the algorithm
  * Hope and probability
  * The recursion - what is the base case (no further recursive calls needed)
  * Lets fill in the code
  * See qsort.c
