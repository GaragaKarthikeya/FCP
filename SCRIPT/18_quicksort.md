  * More complex sorting - quick sort
    * Algorithm - This is the more important part
	- Plan of the algorithm
	- How to get a good pivot (middle most?, worst ?)
	- How to partition around the pivot 
		with extra space vs in-place
		EXERCISE start with fillin_qsort.c (with extra space)  answer is in qsort_extraspace.c
	- Hope and probability
	- The recursion
		- what is the base case (no further recursive calls needed)
	- Lets fill in the code

    * See qsort.c
