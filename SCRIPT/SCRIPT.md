# Motivaion
* OBJECTIVE:  This is motivation for students about why program. The idea is to say that we would like to codify an activity, an algorithm. To seed that idea we take simple mathematical examples.
  * Understand what an algorithm is
  * Write some common algorithms in as clear a way as possible
  * eg. GCD and LCM

* EXAMPLES: gcd.c and lcm.c

* END CLASS EXERCISE: 
  Can you download the following C program and compile it and
  make it run on your PC: https://www.sanfoundry.com/c-program-find-inverse-matrix/
  Now change it a little bit - perhaps change the printf statements a little.


(We will look deeper into what is a statement or expression and all that
later on... I mean the next thing.)

# EXPRESSIONS, STATEMENTS and BLOCKS in C
* OBJECTIVE: 
    * Notion of expressions, statements, blocks
      ( Lets try to look at programs and what its elements are. )
    * Notion of constants and opetators
    * Write a program independently
    * Notion of a variable
    * notion of value vs address

* EXPRESSIONS AND VALUES
    * A program as  a collection of expressions.
    * Expressions are used mainly to get values.
    * They can be arithmetic, logical, etc.
    * See expr.c

So 5+3 is an expression.  
So is 5        (note that expressions dont need to have operators)  
So is 6.023 * 2    ( numbers can be non-integers too)  
 'R'   is a sigle character expression  
Another expression is "hello world"   (this is a sequence of characters)  
5 < 3 	 is a logic expression  
Same with 5 < 3 && 2 > 1   
Clearly we can put paranethesis to make it clear to us (and to others)  

* An arithmetic expression can be converted to a statement by using a ";"
  at the end.
  
* Lets write a fully working program with this expression.

* EXERCISE download and edit main.c

* Lets summarize the learning:  
| Expressions		| "Type" of the value
| --------------------- | -------------------
| 5			| integer
| 5+3			| integer
| 6.023 * 2		| floating point
| 'c'			| single character
| "Hello world"		| character string
| sin(0.5)		| function call expression

* Notions of constants and operators in expressions

* Practicalities
    * Expressions are good but 
        we would like to see something when a program is run
    * We can use some help to print using puts, putchar or printf
  
* NOTION OF STORED VALUES and VARIABLES
    * storing values is an important expression using the familiar '=' sign
  variables have address as well as value, but expressions only have value
    * Notions of memory
        * MODEL of storage and instructions. 
    * go back to objdump --disassemble
* Concept of definition of variables 
    * List of types in variable definitions
    * Notion of scope
    *  (also declaration) - how with extern declaration of a global
    *  We will learn more when we talk about functions

* Lets write a fully working proram with the storing idea
* Proacticality
   * expression and printing is good, but we may want to read something 
   into variables instead of fixing them in the program
   * we can use some help to read using scanf

* The game of guessing 2(x+10)-2x = 20

* Is it possible to get the address value ?





[comment]: # (--------- 03_binary_rep.md ---------)
# BINARY REPRESENTATATION
* OBJECTIVE: Binary representations and arithmentic
* Important to know
* The notion of binary representations
  Why binary?
  examples of binary representations 0 1 2 4 8 3 5 7 16 15
  easier ways to talk binary - Octal and hexadecimal
  How to store a number in binary? examples
   (Just to understand you can see od -cx) and also refer ascii table
  One important concept is that a number like 108 needs only one bytes 
  However to store it as characters needs 3 bytes

  Lets spend some time here.
  Since all stuff is binary. So are non-numbers too.

* With some proactice can you refer ASCII table and say what is stored for 
  "good" in hexadecimal ? What about a word like "hello"?
  wha about doing a od -cx on a file containing exactly that.

* How does arithmetic work on binary numbers
  Addition

* The problem with representation and signs
  Subtraction is addition of 2's complement

* Bit operations (AND OR NOT)

* What is overflow ?
  Problems of integers and precision

* The more important thing is that everything is represented in binary 
	for example characters and even non integer floats

* QUESTIONS: can you use od -cx to see the contents of a file.
             In particular a character file?
	     Can you create a simple ASCII table (char vs hexadecimal)
	     convert these decimal numbers to binary and vice-versa
	     Why is hexadecimal so common ?
